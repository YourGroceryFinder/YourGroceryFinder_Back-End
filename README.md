# The back-end
## Explanation
The programming language i use for the back-end is java. There are many back-end language for web applications like: Rust, Python, C#, Ruby, Java, etc.
I went with Java because i was very curious about it. I have heard about it from allot of people. It is used for many different applications like web applications, android applications, software tools, games and many more. 

Java is object oriented, easy to learn and platform-independent. This is why it seemed like a very usefull programming language to learn and the reason why i choose it.
