# Your Grocery Finder

## What is it?
Your Grocery Finder is a web application i wanted to create to make it easier for people to find their favorite brand groceries in any shop. I noticed that cans of monster enegry were slowly disappearing from the stores even though its my favorite drink. Instead of having to look at every individual store website i thought it would be nice to have 1 big website where i am able to find all these products with ease.

## How it Works
Your Grocery finder works by getting all of the items from different stores into a database and then showing it to the user.
For this i need a few different things:
+ A front-end where the user can search for products.
+ A database where all the products are stored.
+ A back-end that connects the front-end with the database.
+ A Scraper to get all the products from the different websites.

### The front-end
The programming language for the front-end is Vue 3. I Chose to use Vue because it was recommended in allot of places. It is easier to learn the most other programming languages because there is a big community behind it, there are no regular updates so it wont change as much as others, it is intuitive and has great documentation.
